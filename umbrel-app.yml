description: >-
  Campfire is a web-based chat application for teams. Run your own private chat server with all the features you need.


  Features:

  - Multiple chat rooms with access controls

  - Direct messages between users

  - File attachments with image and video previews

  - Search across all messages

  - Web Push notifications

  - @mentions to notify specific users

  - API with support for bot integrations

  - Modern, responsive web interface

  - Self-hosted and privacy-focused


  On first launch, you'll be guided through creating an admin account. This admin can then invite other users and manage rooms and permissions.


  ** Enabling Push Notifications (Optional) **


  Push notifications are OPTIONAL and disabled by default. The app works perfectly without them - all chat features, real-time updates, file sharing, and in-app notifications function normally.


  Push notifications allow users to receive alerts on their phones/devices when the app is closed or they're mentioned in messages. If you don't need this feature, you can skip this setup entirely.


  To enable push notifications:


  1. Generate unique VAPID keys (do this ONCE per Umbrel instance):
     
     Run: npx web-push generate-vapid-keys
     
     This creates a public/private key pair. IMPORTANT: Each Umbrel instance should use unique keys for security.


  2. Edit docker-compose.yml in your app directory:
     
     Find lines 28-29:
     
     VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY: ${VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY:-}
     
     VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY: ${VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY:-}
     
     Replace with your generated keys:
     
     VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY: 'BDxY8z9Q...[your-public-key]...'
     
     VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY: 'abc123XYZ...[your-private-key]...'


  3. Restart the app from Umbrel's interface.


  Security Note: Never share your VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY. Each instance should have unique keys to maintain proper security isolation.
